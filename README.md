# Codacy ESLint

## Adding new plugins / configs

1.  Install the package using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install <package-name>
    ```

2.  \[Plugins only\] Add the plugin to the plugins section in the file `src/eslintDefaultOptions.ts`

3.  \[Plugins only\] If the plugin has descriptions for rules on GitHub, reference them
at `src/eslintDefaultOptions.ts` to include them on the generated documentation. To do this, add a section similar to the following example:

    ```typescript
    console.log("Generate xss description files")
    await docGenerator.downloadDocs(
      (pattern) =>
        `${githubBaseUrl}/Rantanen/eslint-plugin-xss/master/docs/rules/${pattern}.md`,
      "xss"
    )
    ```

4.  Generate documentation so it adds the new plugin documentation

## Generating documentation

```bash
npm install
npm run generateDocs
```
